#Classic Arcade Game Clone

##To play the game:

*	[Play the game here] (https://rajiv-shankar.github.io/Udacity-FEND-Project-3/)
*	The goal of the game is for the **Player** (the sprite at the bottom on the grass) to get to the **River** (the blue row at the top) without colliding with the **Enemies** (the bugs crossing the stone rows at random speeds).  
*	The **arrow keys** move the Player.  
*	If the Player reaches the Water without a *collision*, you **score 100 points**, which keep increasing each time you make the journey successfully.  
*	If there is a collision your **score resets to 0**. 
*	To **restart** the game, just refresh the browser window (F5 on PCs).
